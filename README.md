# Truth-Functional Logic

This is a single-page React app that produces an interface for generating truth
tables from valid sentences in TFL. The mechanically interesting pieces here can
be found in the `src/lib/logic` folder, which contains both the (pretty banal)
representation and behavior of sentences in TFL, and the logic for parsing user
input into an in-code representation of that sentence.
